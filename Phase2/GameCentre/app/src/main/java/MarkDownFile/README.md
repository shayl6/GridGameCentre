If you don't have one, you can register one by clicking the register button. To successfully 
register an account, you need to enter an available account name, and then click ‘CHECK AVAILABLE’

and then press register to finish registration. After you successfully registered, the app will jump

you on this page. If you press change password, then you need to first enter you account email and 
the corresponding password, then press ‘CHECK AVAILABLE’ to check whether this is an existed email 
and the password is correct. If it says “OK!”, then you can enter you new password, and after you
